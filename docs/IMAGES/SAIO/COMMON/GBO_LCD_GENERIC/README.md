### Test fit
Prepare how the LCD fits:

![Test fit](https://github.com/geebles/Super-AIO/raw/master/docs/IMAGES/SAIO/COMMON/GBO_LCD_GENERIC/1.jpg)

1mm from the 'lip':

![Align 2](https://github.com/geebles/Super-AIO/raw/master/docs/IMAGES/SAIO/COMMON/GBO_LCD_GENERIC/3.jpg)
![Align 3](https://github.com/geebles/Super-AIO/raw/master/docs/IMAGES/SAIO/COMMON/GBO_LCD_GENERIC/4.jpg)

Make sure all lumps are flattened as the LCD will be pushed up against them if they are there:

### Tack in place
Align LCD and place VERY SMALL blobs of glue. It is a good idea to place ONE blob on the bottom, and keeping the 1mm all around alignment. Then when cool place the other one or two blobs just to hold it:

### Test
Connect up the board, the best way is to place the board as pictured and connect the ribbon, then lever down. Repeat in reverse to remove:

Boot and check everything is aligned ok:

# Prepare posts
In order to mount the posts, they need to end up being the approx height shown in this picture. The TOP is lower than the BOTTOM ones. We need to replicate these when the LCD is installed, but gluing them to the back of the LCD:

Place the back case on, and using something sharp make scratches on the back of the LCD to work out the position of posts:

![Mark holes](https://github.com/geebles/Super-AIO/raw/master/docs/IMAGES/SAIO/COMMON/GBO_LCD_GENERIC/10.jpg)

Inspect for scratches:

Mark with dots:

Prepare posts:

![Prep 1](https://github.com/geebles/Super-AIO/raw/master/docs/IMAGES/SAIO/COMMON/GBO_LCD_GENERIC/13.jpg)

Sand and cut the posts to length:

![Prep 2](https://github.com/geebles/Super-AIO/raw/master/docs/IMAGES/SAIO/COMMON/GBO_LCD_GENERIC/14.jpg)

Sand the LCD, re-mark where necessary:

### Tack posts in place
Tack the post in place, do this by using a bead of hot glue on the tip:

![Glue 1](https://github.com/geebles/Super-AIO/raw/master/docs/IMAGES/SAIO/COMMON/GBO_LCD_GENERIC/16.jpg)

Place down quickly:

![Glue 2](https://github.com/geebles/Super-AIO/raw/master/docs/IMAGES/SAIO/COMMON/GBO_LCD_GENERIC/17.jpg)

Place the back half over again, and check for alignment. Remove if really out and try again:

![Check](https://github.com/geebles/Super-AIO/raw/master/docs/IMAGES/SAIO/COMMON/GBO_LCD_GENERIC/18.jpg)

If alignment good, then prepare where to glue. The following image shows the best places to pile up glue:

![Prep glue](https://github.com/geebles/Super-AIO/raw/master/docs/IMAGES/SAIO/COMMON/GBO_LCD_GENERIC/19.jpg)

It should end up like this:

![Glue main 1](https://github.com/geebles/Super-AIO/raw/master/docs/IMAGES/SAIO/COMMON/GBO_LCD_GENERIC/20.jpg)

![Glue main 2](https://github.com/geebles/Super-AIO/raw/master/docs/IMAGES/SAIO/COMMON/GBO_LCD_GENERIC/21.jpg)

![Glue main 3](https://github.com/geebles/Super-AIO/raw/master/docs/IMAGES/SAIO/COMMON/GBO_LCD_GENERIC/22.jpg)

### Trim glue
Using a knife, cut down the glue in the problem area:

Test fit:

![Fit](https://github.com/geebles/Super-AIO/raw/master/docs/IMAGES/SAIO/COMMON/GBO_LCD_GENERIC/24.jpg)

The following image shows the areas to avoid with glue in red:

![Fit area](https://github.com/geebles/Super-AIO/raw/master/docs/IMAGES/SAIO/COMMON/GBO_LCD_GENERIC/25.jpg)

### Check regularly
When complete, should look like this:

![Fit complete](https://github.com/geebles/Super-AIO/raw/master/docs/IMAGES/SAIO/COMMON/GBO_LCD_GENERIC/26.jpg)

The last step is to then add more glue around the edge of the LCD. Test for fit again.

### Prepare button wells
Get your parts, and work out how you want to fit it. Begin by sanding down the areas to glue:

Prepare tubes of paper in a cone shape, this will make it easier to line up:

Insert tube from the inside:

Place both tubes and line up notches:

Glue with the tubes still inserted, when cooled remove and inspect:

Test fit:

Test fit and trim membrane. You may find that the bottom pictured needs cutting off. This makes the buttons feel firmer:

Trim the glue down if necessary:

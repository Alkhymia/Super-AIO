### Locate drill holes
Pick which drill holes to use, 'normal' is recommended. Using a 1.5mm drill bit, push through and scratch the drill hole points:

### Remove posts in the way
Using a knife is recommended.

A sharp angle will get a clean cut. Be careful and work it slowly.. the plastic is soft:

Drill pilot holes (3mm):

Using a step drill, turn slowly by hand. Put it pliers to get better grip:

Proceed to the 11mm mark:

Using a countersink bit, carefully make a countersunk edge to the hole:

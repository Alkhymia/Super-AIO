Drill holes a little but bigger than your actual buttons:

You may want to use a larger drill bit to sink the holes slightly:

By using some perfboard and solder, you can make a small button assembly:

Place assembly and cover with glue:

You don't have to make an assembly, just wire up the buttons first and then glue in place:

Cutting out the LCD space.

### Measure up
Place your screen protector and measure up and mark out how much you need to remove:

On the inside, remove all posts that are in the way. If you plan to use these later for the mounting posts then make sure to cut them so that they are as long as possible:

Ideally using a knife cut out the area, or use a rotary cutting tool. Don't try and get it perfect first try, cut it out roughly and then use a knife to neaten up afterwards:

Pop out the cut:

Using a knife, carve the edges. The plastic is soft and cuts really easily:

Cheak regularly for fit:

Finished cutout. NOTE don't stick the protector in yet, do this AFTER you have glued the LCD in, otherwise it will be hard to clean and get dust free:

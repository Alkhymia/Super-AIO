### Build notes
Fitting this LCD is not as simple as the normal 320x240 one due to it being slightly wider than the case and also the one edge of the LCD is quite thick. You do not have to follow all these steps of make the modifications if you don't want to, however you may see some of the metal/black stuff through the LCD cutout. These steps are mainly to try and reduce that, but it's not that easy..

### Preparing case for LCD
Do the screen surround cut out as per normal steps in guide. It is a good idea to use a black marker to run on the inside edge of the cutout so when viewed at an angle you can't see the grey plastic.

The 640x480 LCD is very slighly wider than the shell.. it is required that the inside of the case needs to be trimmed to allow it to fit, and also for proper alignment.

The only edge that needs indenting (for a better word) is the side with the CONTRAST slot. This is the side where the thick piece of metal on the LCD is closest to.

To make the indent, I used a rotary tool with the pink grinding attachment and VERY SLOWLY took away a layer at a time. I then used a small FLAT file (rectangular tip) to slide up and down the area to make it neater.

NOTE: Prepare the LCD first (see further steps) as you will need to keep placing it to make sure it fits. With the modifications to the LCD the middle of the indentation will require the most material removed. The top and bottom won't need so much removing.

Keep filing and grinding it iterativly:

If you hold it up to a light, you will be able to see light through it when the wall is getting thin. Do this often to avoid making holes in the side. You can see in the following image that I actually broke through the wall. From the outside it isn't noticable so I'm going to leave it as is. You could use some plastic filler:

### Prepare LCD
We need to make the biggest edge of the LCD as slim as possible, and we can modify the LCD itself and trim some of the WHITE plastic and also the METAL SHELL. Start by removing the outer metal shell. This is done by slowly unclipping the edge clips and levering out:

Trim the top edges with a sharp knife VERY CAREFULLY. DO NOT CUT INTO THE BLACK STUFF AT ALL, IT WILL DAMAGE THE LCD.

These are the bits that we are specifically targetting, and the WHITE ONLY:

Trim the metal shell with a cutting disk. you could choose to not put the metal shell back on at all! It may lower the brightness as the inside metal is used for reflective gains:

Connect up the adapter. When it goes inside the case it will be folded as shown in the image below:

If the trimmings have been done as per the previous steps, you should have a edge-less LCD viewing area as shown below:

NOTE: In this sample fitting I cut into the BLACK stuff when trimming the LCD.. as you can see on the RIGHT half of the LCD it is only showing every other pixel! You have been warned!
